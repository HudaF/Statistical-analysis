#Inertia: in veganâs language, this is the general term for âvariationâ in the data
#In PCA, the âinertiaâ is either the sum of the variances of the variables (PCA on a covariance matrix) or
#in this case (PCA on a correlation matrix), the sum of the diagonal values of the correlation matrix, 
#i.e. the sum of all correlations of the variables with themselves, corresponds to number of variables

#Eigenvalues: symbolized lj, these are measures of the importance (variance) of the axes. 
#They can be expressed as Proportions Explained, or proportions of variation accounted for, by dividing them by the total inertia.

#Scaling: âScalingâ refers to the way ordination results are projected in the reduced space 
#for graphical display. There is no single way to optimally display objects and variables 
#together in a PCA biplot, i.e. a plot showing two types of results, here the sites and the variables.
#Two main types of scaling are used:

#Scaling 1 = distance biplot: the eigenvectors are scaled to unit length.
#Distances among objects in the biplot are approximations of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. 
#This means that distances between datapoint on the plot are accurate but angles between variables in the biplot do not reflect their correlation

#Scaling 2 = Scaling 2= correlation biplot: each eigenvector is scaled to the square root of 
#its eigenvalue. Distances between datapoints or sites or rows in the biplot are not 
#approximations of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. The angles between descriptors 
#in the biplot reflect their correlations

####Species scores: coordinates of the arrow heads of the variables. 
#For historical reasons, response variables are always called âspeciesâ in vegan, 
#no matter what they represent.

####Site scores: coordinates of the sites in the ordination diagram. 
#Objects are always called âSitesâ in vegan output file

# In scaling =1, the radius of this circle represents the length of the vector representing 
#a variable that would contribute equally to all the dimensions of the PCA space.
#for any given pair of axes, the variables that have vectors longer than this radius 
#make a higher contribution than average

#The variables:

#Population exposed to hap
#Agriculture Forest Fishery Value
#GDP
#HealthCare expenditure 
#Make higher contribution then average

#The variables Median ppb and Agriculture forest fishery value are closely associated
#Explain 

#PCA is not a statistical test, but a heuristic procedure.  
#It aims at representing the major features of the data along a reduced number of axes 
#hence, the expression âordination in reduced spaceâ

#In our lecture, we examined the eigenvalues (i.e. proportion of variance explained)
#and decided how many axes were worth representing and displaying on the basis of the amount of variance explained

#Rather than choosing arbritarily, we can use a few procedure to standardize selection of components
#One option is KaiserâGuttman criterion) 
#It consists of computing the mean of all eigenvalues and interpreting only the axes whose eigenvalues are larger than that mean.

#To do this, we will need to pull out the eigenvalues
(ev <- log_df.pca$CA$eig)

# Apply Kaiser-Guttman criterion to select axes
ev[ev > mean(ev)] #pulling out eigenvalues that are larger than the mean eigenvalue

#PC1, PC2 and PC3 are greater than mean

#Another option is to compute the broken stick model

#This model which randomly divides a stick of unit length into the same number of pieces as there are PCA axes.
#The pieces are then put in order of decreasing length and compared to the eigenvalues.
#Only components with eigenvalues that are larger than the length of the corresponding piece of the stick are selected

#Building broken stick model

n <- length(ev) #findiing out the number of variables
bsm <- data.frame(j=seq(1:n), p=0) #creating an empty dataset
bsm$p[1] <- 1/n 
for (i in 2:n)
{
  bsm$p[i] = bsm$p[i-1] + (1/(n + 1 - i))
}
bsm$p <- 100*bsm$p/n
bsm

# Combining clustering and ordination results

#We can compare a cluster analysis and an ordination to explain or confirm the differences between groups of sites.
#Here, I have used two ways of combining these results
#The first differentiates clusters of sites by colours on the ordination plot
#the second overlays a dendrogram on the plot

# Clustering the objects using the environmental data: Euclidean 
# distance after standardizing the variables, followed by Ward clustering
env.w <- hclust(dist(scale(log_df[-c(1)])), "ward")
# Cut the dendrogram to yield 4 groups
gr <- cutree(env.w, k=4)
grl <- levels(factor(gr))

# Get the site scores, scaling 1
sit.sc1 <- scores(log_df.pca, display="wa", scaling=1)
#We use scaling 1 because we need accurate distances

# Plot the sites with cluster symbols and colours (scaling 1)
windows(title="Ordination and clustering")
p <- plot(log_df.pca, display="wa", scaling=1, type="n", 
          main="PCA correlation + clusters")
abline(v=0, lty="dotted")

  points(sit.sc1[gr==i,], pch=(14+i), cex=2, col=i+1)

#The points are very close together
